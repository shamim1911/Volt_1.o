Here are the connections for your pocket computer project:

OLED Display:
- Connect GND (Ground) of the OLED to GND on the Arduino.
- Connect VCC (Power) of the OLED to 5V on the Arduino.
- Connect SCL (Serial Clock) of the OLED to A5 on the Arduino.
- Connect SDA (Serial Data) of the OLED to A4 on the Arduino.

Potentiometer:
- Connect the left pin (GND) of the potentiometer to GND on the Arduino.
- Connect the right pin (VCC/5V) of the potentiometer to 5V on the Arduino.
- Connect the middle pin (wiper/SIG) of the potentiometer to A0 on the Arduino.

Buzzer:
- Connect one pin of the buzzer to GND on the Arduino.
- Connect the other pin of the buzzer to D9 on the Arduino.

Push Buttons (Three Buttons):
- Connect one side of each push button to GND on the Arduino.
- Connect the other side of each push button to separate digital pins on the Arduino: D4, D5, and D6.

LED Indicator:
- Connect one leg of the LED (the longer one, anode, positive side) to a 1k ohm current-limiting resistor.
- Connect the other end of the current-limiting resistor to digital pin D7 on the Arduino.
- Connect the shorter leg of the LED (cathode, negative side) directly to GND on the Arduino.

Please ensure that all connections are secure, and double-check for any wiring errors before powering up your project. If you have specific values for your LED and resistor, use those values for the current-limiting resistor.

Happy building, and feel free to ask if you have any more questions!
